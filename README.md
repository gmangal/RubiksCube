TODO:
    Check if Ankush can make use GitHub Properly
    Create method to scramble the cube
    Remove all I/O features
        Remove readCube and writeCube methods
    Remove commands ArrayList
    Extract main from RubiksCube.java into its own class. RubiksCube.java should
        represent our model and nothing else.
    Modify RubiksCube.java so that its constructor constructs a solved cube.
    Create a class to hold all the GUI components.
    **Optional** Improve efficiency by manually writing each rotation method 
        instead of calling other rotation methods
