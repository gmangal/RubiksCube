    correspond to colors on the Rubik's cube. This information is in the 
    documentation of the program itself, but is copied here as well:

TODO:
    Remove all I/O features
        Remove readCube and writeCube methods
    Remove commands ArrayList
    Remove main from RubiksCube.java. RubiksCube.java should represent our model
        and nothing else.
    Turn project into an applet
    Create a method that checks if the cube is solved
    Modify RubiksCube.java so that its constructor constructs a solved cube.
    Create a class to hold all the GUI components.
    **Optional** Improve efficiency by manually writing each rotation method 
        instead of calling other rotation methods
